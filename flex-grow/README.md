# flex-grow Demo

A visual demo to understand how the CSS Flexbox `flex-grow` property works.

## Overview

This demo compares the following 4 patterns:

1. `flex-grow: 0` (default) — Items stay at their content width
2. All items `flex-grow: 1` — Remaining space is distributed equally
3. `flex-grow` set to 1 : 2 : 1 — Remaining space is distributed proportionally
4. Only one item `flex-grow: 1` — That item absorbs all remaining space

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your browser:

```sh
open index.html
```

Try resizing the browser window to see how items stretch differently in each pattern.
